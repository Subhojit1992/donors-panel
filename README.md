Simply open up the index.html file in local or in your server. Now put some value in the input field and enter “Give now” button to see the interaction. Hover over the progress bar to see how much dollar you need to submit.

Now if you press the "Tell a friends" button you can see a pop up open in the card section with facebook, google-plus and twitter. And if you hit "Save for later" then you will see a loader will arrive and after that a message will come.

This whole UI made without using any images.
